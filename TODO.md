# TODO: Fix Category Card Items

## Completed Tasks

- [x] Move medical.jpeg image from src/assets to public/assets for correct serving
- [x] Update placeholder image path in HomeView.vue to use public asset path
- [x] Remove filter to show all 8 categories instead of only those with 4+ items
- [x] Fix category card layout to prevent overflow with flexbox
- [x] Adjust image grid and items for consistent alignment across all category cards
- [x] Ensure 8 category cards display in two rows with uniform item spacing

## Summary

Fixed the category card items by:

1. Correcting image paths to use public assets instead of src assets
2. Displaying all 8 categories in two rows (removed minimum item count filter)
3. Implementing flexbox layout for consistent card heights and content distribution
4. Standardizing image item alignment with uniform spacing and heights
5. Ensuring the 2x2 grid layout is consistent across all category cards

The home page category cards now display properly with 8 categories in two rows, consistent alignment, and no overflow issues.
